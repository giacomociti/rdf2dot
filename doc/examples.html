    <h1>Rdf Visualization Rules - Examples</h1>
    <p>
        A brief showcase (work in progress) of the main visualization rules and some hints to create custom ones.
    </p>
    
    <p>Given the following example dataset:</p>
    <pre id="data1"></pre>

    <p>let's see how it is rendered with some general purpose rules:</p>

    <h3>basic</h3>
    <p>
      With the <em>basic</em> rules, every triple is shown as a link between its subject and object.
      The edge label is the local name obtained from the property URI, which is available as tooltip.
      Literal nodes have rectangular shape and the tooltip is either the data type or the language tag.
      Blank nodes are empty circles and regular URI nodes have the local name as label and the full URI as tooltip.
      This kind of diagram contains all the information of the dataset, but it is suitable only for very small ones.  
    </p>
    <div id="basic1"></div>
    
    <h3>default</h3>
    <p>
      The <em>default</em> rules make compact visualizations: only the subjects of some triple become nodes, 
      hence literal values are embedded in the subject node label.
    </p>
    <div id="default1"></div>
